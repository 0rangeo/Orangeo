## Notes: 
- Homeostasis is the tendency of the body to maintain a constant, stable, internal environment. 
- There are different areas of homeostasis such as [[thermoregulation]], [[glucoregulation]] and [[osmoregulation]]
- The human body maintains homeostasis through two systems: [[Nervous system]] and [[Endocrine System]]
- In humans, the heat balance results in a body core temperature of 37 degrees Celsius.
- 37 degrees Celsius is the optimal temperature for cells and enzymes to function.
