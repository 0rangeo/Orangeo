## Notes:
- Molecular genetic testing is used to identify single genes or short lengths of DNA
- Molecular genetic testing is the most effective method if the gene sequence of interest is known and the function of the protein is unknown
- Two of the most common procedures used are:
	- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based array
	- Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis


## Questions:
Q: What are the two most common procedures used to achieve molecular genetic testing?
