## Notes:
- Functional neuroimaging refers to techniques that provide views of some particular aspect of brain function by showing images of the brain 'at work'. 
- Two examples of functional neuroimaging are:
	- Positron emission tomography (PET)
	- Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
- Positron emission tomography produces colour images showing brain structure, activity and function. 
- PET works by tracking a glucose solution containing a short-lived radioactive tracer which is injected into the bloodstream.
- fMRI uses standard MRI technology and produces images like those of a PET scanner but better.

Q: Why is fMRI better than PET?
A: PET scans require the use of a radioactive tracer whereas fMRI scans do not, which is safer for patients.
