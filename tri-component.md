--- 

Attitudes can be modelled by the tricomponent model which has 3 areas:
-  [[Affective component]] - How we feel about the attitude object.
- [[Behavioural component]] - How we act towards the attitude object.
- [[Cognitive component]] - What we know or think we know about the attitude object.
 ***The tri-component model proposes that all three components must be present before it can be said that an attitude exists***
 
 Q: What are the 3 components of the tricomponent model of attitudes?
A: Affective component, Behavioural component, Cognitive component.


An attitude exists if {all three components of the tricomponent model of attitudes are present}.
