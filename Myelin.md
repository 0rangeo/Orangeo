## Notes:
- The axons of many, though not all, neurons are myelinated.
- Myelin is a white, fatty substance that coats and helps insulate the axon from the activity of other nearby axons
- The coating is called the **myelin sheath**
- The myelin sheath is not a continuous coating, it occurs in segments that are separated by small gaps called **nodes of Ranvier**.
- Neurons wrapped in myelin communicate their messages much faster than unmyelinated neurons.
