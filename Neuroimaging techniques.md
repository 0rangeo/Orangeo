## Notes:
- Neuroimaging is a technique that captures a picture of the brain.
- Generally, the different neuroimaging techniques can be divided into two categories: 
	- [[Structural neuroimaging]]: Techniques that provide views of the brain's appearance and structure.
	- [[Functional neuroimaging]]: Techniques that provide views of some particular aspect of brain function by showing images of bran activity.
- One important aspect of neuroimaging is that it helps overcome significant ethical constraints in studying the live, intact brain as well as the injured brain 
- Neuroimaging is relatively non-invasive, therefore the risk of harm to participants is minimal if not negligible
