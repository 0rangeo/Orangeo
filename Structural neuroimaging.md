## Notes:
- Structural neuroimaging refers to techniques that produce images or scans of brain structure and anatomy.
- Two methods of structural neuroimaging are computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
- Computerised tomography uses x-ray equipment to scan the brain at different angles.
- For a CT scan of the brain, the patient must be given a substance called contrast which highlights the brain's blood vessels and enables interpretations of the scans.
- CT has significant limitations, the black and white images only show brain structure with lower resolution than other types of scanners and X-rays emit radiation which are not particularly good for imaging tissue.
- Magnetic resonance imaging uses magnetic fields to vibrate atoms in the brain's neurons and generate a computer image of the brain.
- The MRI technique is more sensitive than CT

Q: How does computerised tomography work?
A: X-ray equipment scans the brain at different angles and then a computer builds a picture of a horizontal cross-section of the brain.
