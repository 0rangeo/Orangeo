## Notes: 
- The [[mind-body problem]] involves the question of whether our mind and body are distinct entities or whether they are one and the same. 
- Generally Greek philosophers believed that the mind could affect the body but the body couldn't affect the mind. 
- This view was popular until it was challenged by French philosopher Rene Descartes.
- Descartes' theory of dualism posited that the mind and body are two different things however they both come into contact through the pineal gland. 
- Descartes identified the pineal gland because it is a single structure near the centre of the brain which is part of the corpus callosum
