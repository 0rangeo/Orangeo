### Notes:
- Discrimination refers to positive or negative behaviour that is directed towards a social group and its members.
- There are two types of discrimination: direct and indirect.
- Direct discrimination occurs when a person treats or proposes to treat someone unfavourably because of a personal characteristic protected by the law. (it happens because people make an unfair assumption about what people with certain personal attributes can or cannot do.)
- Indirect discrimination occurs when treating everybody the same way disadvantages someone because of personal characteristics. e.g. not having ramps located around the school.
