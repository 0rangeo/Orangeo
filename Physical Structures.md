## Notes: 
- 3 transparent, 'skin-like' membranes called meninges protect and keep the brain in place.
- Cerebrospinal fluid provides a cushion against knocks and protects against injury.
- The outer layer of the brain is called the cerebral cortex.
- The largest and inner part of the brain is called the cerebrum.
- The darker areas of the brain are called grey matter are largely composed of nerve cell bodies and their local connections to each other. 
- The outer cerebral cortex layer is entirely made up of grey matter.
- The lighter areas are called white matter and are mostly nerve fibres that connect distant bran areas to one another. 
- The cerebrum is mostly composed of white matter.
- The band of nerve tissue between the two cerebral hemispheres is called the corpus callosum
