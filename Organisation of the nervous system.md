## Notes:
- There are two main divisions in the nervous system: 
	- The [[central nervous system]]: Comprises of the brain and spinal cord
	- The [[peripheral nervous system]]: All the parts of the nervous system includes all parts of the nervous system that lie outside the brain and the spinal cord.
- The central and nervous systems are connected and interdependent.
