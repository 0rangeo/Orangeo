## Notes:
- The peripheral nervous system is the entire network of nerves located outside the central nervous system that transmits information to and from the central nervous system.
- The PNS depends on the CNS to process the information it sends and to initiate a response that the PNS carries to various parts of the body.
- The peripheral nervous system has two subdivisions:
	- The [[somatic nervous system]]
	- The [[autonomic nervous system]]
