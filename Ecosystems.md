## Notes: 
- Ecosystems can be classified into general types that contain similar types of organsisms. They are called biomes.
- The world's major land ecosystems are called [[terrestrial ecosystems]].
-The world's major water ecosystems are called [[aquatic ecosystems]].
- Ecosystems are the interactions between [[abiotic factors]] and [[biotic factors]]. 
- Organisms can only survive within a range of conditions, these are called [[tolerance limits]].
- Population density is the number of individuals per unit of area.
- Population distribution is the pattern of dispersal of individuals across an area which could be affected by resources available (biotic and abiotic)
- The three distribution patterns are clumped, random and uniform
- An **open ecosystem** is where migration between populations of living organisms can occur.
- A **closed ecosystem** is where the growth rate depends only on birth and death rates, and there is no migration.
- Population explosions occur when an ecosystem doesn't have sufficient factors to limit the population growth. For example the crown of thorns starfish in the Great Barrier Reef have abundant food resources, high reproductive success but few predators.
- **Carrying capacity** is the population size that the environment can sustain for a period of time. 
- Determined by:
	- Renewable resources
	- Nonrenewable resources (land)
- Organisms that no longer live on Earth are said to be **extinct**
- Factors that determine the distribution and abundance of the gray teal:
	- Environmental factors: 
	- Behavioural and physical adaptations:
	- Interactions:
- The lag phase refers to the initial period where population growth is slow.
- The log phase refers to the initial period where population growth is exponential
- The stationary phase refers to the initial period where population numbers fluctuate around the carrying capacity.
