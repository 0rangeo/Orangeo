## Notes: 
- The optimal temperature for humans is 37 degrees Celsius.
- There are four ways for heat to transfer:
	1. Radiation: Heat that radiates away to other objects indirectly
	2. Convection: When a stream of air is cooler than the body surface temperature
	3. Conduction: The direct transfer of heat when objects of different temperatures come into contact with each other.
	4. Evaporation: Heat loss due to water evaporating and drawing heat away
- The receptors involved in thermoregulation are called thermoreceptors which can be divided into two types:
	- Exteroceptors: Receptors that detect external temperature variations
	- Interoceptors: Receptors that detect internal temperature variations
- The hypothalamus is a region of the brain and acts as the control centre in thermoregulation. 
- The hypothalamus can detect the temperature of blood and responds to temperature changes by sending messages to the appropriate effectors.
- Blood vessels can:
	- Vasodilate: Smooth muscle relaxes which increases lumen diameter and increases blood flow.
	- Vasoconstrict: Smooth muscle constricts which decreases lumen diameter and reduces blood flow.
- When the outside temperature is extremely cold, the skeletal muscles involuntarily contact which generates heat for the body.
- Organisms can be classified as either "endotherms" or "ectotherms"
	- Ectotherms: An organism whose regulation of body temperature depends on the external environment
	- Endotherms: An organism whose regulation of body temperature depends on internal metabolic processes.

<!--ID: 1623559329050-->


Q: Give an example of an exteroceptor.
A: Thermoreceptors that are located in the skin.
<!--ID: 1623559329117-->


Q: Give 2 reasons for why penguins' feet don't freeze.
A: Their blood vessels constrict to minimise heat loss and their veins and arteries are positioned close together so that countercurrent heat exchange warms up the deoxygenated blood
