## Notes:
- The spinal cord is the long, thing bundle of nerve tissue that extends from the base of the brain to the lower back.
- The spine is encased in a series of bones called **vertebrae**
- Two major functions of the spinal cord are:
	- Receive sensory information from the [[peripheral nervous system|PNS]] and send these messages to the brain for processing
	- Receive motor information from the brain and send it to relevant parts of the body to control muscles, glands and internal organs so that appropriate actions can be taken.
- The spinal cord can also initiate simple responses independently of the brain.
- Spinal reflex responses are involuntary and occur automatically in response to certain stimuli without any involvement of the brain.
