> I will get a 50 study score for methods

## To do today:
- [ ] Finished Anki review

## Diary:
### Most memorable event:
Today methods results came out. I got 44.5 out of 55 which is 80.9%. This is much worse than i was expecting i was hoping for high 80's. I know i got beaten by Kriti, Anderson and Kevin so that's unfortunate but hopefully i can still get a high study score. It's not the worst score because i beat most of my other friends (Jared still doesn't have his score but im pretty sure he beat me because his comment is up and it says he got an excellent score). Psych was pretty fun as well because we got to eat lollies and create a neuron. We also played flappy golf and we had like 6 people which is pretty good for a flappy golf lobby.

### Today I learned...
that I need to study hard to get a 50 study score for methods

### Something I achieved:
I got 81% for methods 1 sac.
