## Diary:
### Most memorable event:
Today we came back from NSW. It was actually pretty fun, on the first day we went camel riding and played in an arcade. The day after that we climbed up a mountain and went whale watching. Yesterday we were meant to go tobogganing but it was raining heavily so we went rollerskating and did a little bit of mini golf. Also had a covid test when we came back from NSW which wasn't very enjoyable. 
### Today I learned...
Didn't really learn anything

### Something I achieved:
I setup the app that makes ipad or phone into a trackpad or keyboard and connected it to PC.
