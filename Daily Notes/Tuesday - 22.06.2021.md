## Diary:
### Most memorable event:

Today we caught the lunch thief. It was pretty fun atcually, everyone was standing around and watching the bench but we didn't stand next to the tree like usual and went to the other tree and watched so we thought the thief wouldn't come. Then towards the end of lunch he came and took and Dishant started questioning him and then we all ran towards him. He tried to like resist but koosha and i held him down and then the substitute or student teachers came and dealt with him. Tbh i feel bad for him because he's probably poor and doesn't have food but like he shouldn't steal full containers and apparently he stole Lakitha's thermos and those are kinda expensive. His name was Dinon Gunasekara.
