## Diary:
### Most memorable event:
Today psychology was pretty chill and fun, but also METHODS RESULTS FOR ONE CLASS CAME OUT. My results aren't up yet but I'm hoping for above 80 at least but the highest in that class was like 78 which is surprising because the test wasn't that bad. Psych was really relaxed and fun today everyone was just talking and it was really nice

### Today I learned...
nothing much

### Something I achieved:
I answered everything at the start of the psych lesson when she asked about the divisions of the nervous system. We hadn't learned anything and i answered everything correctly which was pretty cool lol
