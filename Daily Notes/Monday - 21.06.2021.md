## Diary:
### Most memorable event:
Today Ethan's lunchbox got stolen as well lol. Yatta's lunch got stolen last Thursday and my pasta got stolen last Wednesday. Tomorrow I'm gonna stand watch and try catch whoever is taking food.
Oh also i got in trouble for the basketball thing last Thursday. Basically last Thursday the nurse told us to get off the court after school, and then Ian and Yatta kept taking the last shot, and she asked for the ball. Then Ian was like "What'd you say" and she repeated and he was like "Nah why" and then Ethan said "Ian pass it to me" and Ian passed and then Ethan ran away. Ethan ran super fast lol and then left us all there. Yatta and I started walking away quickly and then when we got near the toilets we ran because we were out of the nurse's sight. Then when everyone grouped up later at the carpark, Ian just yelled oh fuck she's there and the nurse came out near the hall with mr mcguire. We all dispersed and then ian said that she asked him for ethan's name and he said Nathaniel. Then she said come with me to senior school and put her hands on him and he said "Get off of me". Then she asked for his Id code and Ian said "0027" and ran away. Today Miss Bradbury summoned me in spesh and also yatta and ian were there. Turns out there are cameras near those toilets and year 12 locker bays so mental note to never run that way again because it was only us who were caught. Then we were sent to Miss Wastle who singled us out and asked what happened and if we thought our behaviour was appropriate. I said yes and nodded and she was like "Yes you think your behvaoiur was appropriate?" and i was like "Yup" and kept nodding. I kept trying not to smile because Ian gave dumb answers lol. When we were at senior school Ian walked up to Yatta and I at lunch and went "BAP BAP BAP" and made gun signs at us which made me laugh so much.
