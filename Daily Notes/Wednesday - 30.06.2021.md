## Diary:
### Most memorable event:
Today we watched Fast and Furious 9 which was pretty fun. Also preordered tickets for next wednesday for Black Widow. Ohh also another episode of Loki came out today and it was really good, it went through lots of plot and imo the other marvel shows had a rushed ending. I don't think Loki will have a rushed ending because of the longer episode times and there are still 2 more episodes and if they both are paced as quickly as episode 4 then it should be fine.
