## Notes: 
- Osmoregulation is based largely on the controlled movement of solutes between internal fluids and the external environment.
- Osmoregulators expend energy to control water uptake and loss in a hyperosmotic or hypoosmotic environment.
- Animals who conserve water excrete uric acid 
- There are three types of nitrogenous wastes:
	- Ammonia
	- Urea
	- Uric acid
- Mammals have various adaptations to conserve water:
	- Kidneys produce hypertonic urine
	- Metabolism of stored fat produces water
	- Reduced sweat glands
	- Some have elongated Loop of Henle to reabsorb more water
	- Some animals have nostrils to trap water vapour
- Pituitary gland gland releases the hormone ADH (antidiuretic hormone)
- ADH is responsible for increasing the amount of water that will be reabsorbed into the body.

<!--ID: 1623644976213-->


Q: What is the name of the part of the kidney that is involved in the reabsorption of water?
A: The Loop of Henle
<!--ID: 1623644976325-->


Q: What is the function of the Loop of Henle?
A: The Loop of Henle recovers and reabsorbs water and sodium chloride from urine.
<!--ID: 1623644976441-->


If there is a {high} concentration of solute in the blood or the water concentration is {low}: {HIGH OSMOTIC PRESSURE}
<!--ID: 1623644977024-->


If there is a {low} concentration of solute in the blood or the water concentration is {high}: {LOW OSMOTIC PRESSURE}
<!--ID: 1623644977141-->


Q: Where are osmoreceptors located?
A: In the hypothalamus
<!--ID: 1623644976554-->


Q: What is the name of the hormone that regulates osmotic pressure?
A: ADH (antidiuretic hormone)
<!--ID: 1623644976693-->


Q: What does ADH stand for?
A: Antidiuretic hormone
<!--ID: 1623644976805-->


Q: What does an increase in ADH result in?
A: Results in more water being reabsorbed into the body and more concentrated urine.
