# Brain ablation experiments
## Notes: 
- Brain ablation involves disabling, destroying, or removing selected brain tissue followed by an assessment of subsequent changes in behaviour.
- Ablation is most often done with scalpel cuts. 
- Ablation is also sometimes called lesioning because it involves brain injury.
- Ablation is irreversible.
- Ablation for ex
- Pierre Flourens is credited with introducing brain ablation experiments. 
- Flourens found that the removal of small bits of tissue in specific areas of the cortex would result in a loss of movement, however animals could eventually recover this function. 
- This finding was the first evidence of neuroplasticity.
- Flourens' research was criticised due to his imprecise surgical procedures which may have confounded his results and his lack of detailed reports on his research.
- American psychologist Karl Lashley's used ablation to determine the location of learning and memory in the brain. 
- Lashley failed to produce amnesia and concluded that learning and memory were located throughout the brain rather than in a single place.
- Lashley's ablation experiments led him to develop two principles of brain function:
	- Mass action: The idea that the large areas of the brain function as a whole in complex functions and that if a part is destroyed then loss of function will depend on the amount of cortex that is destroyed.
	- Equipotentiality: The idea that any healthy part of the cortex can take over the function of an injured part. See [[neuroplasticity]]

Q: Why did Karl Lashley use ablation?
A: Lashley used ablation to determine the location of learning and memory in the brain.

Ablation is also sometimes called {lesioning} because it involves brain injury, usually irreversibly

Q: When is ablation ethical?
A: When it is used for brain tumour removal

Q: Are experiments using brain ablation ethical?
A: No, because it involves brain injury that is usually irreversible.
