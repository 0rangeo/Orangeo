## Notes: 
- Glucose is the main source of chemical energy for most heterotrophs.
- Glucagon is an endocrine hormone secreted by the pancreas which increases blood glucose concentration by converting stored glycogen to glucose.
- Insulin is an endocrine hormone secreted by the pancreas which decreases blood glucose concentration by concerting excess glucose and storing it as glycogen in the [[liver]] or muscles
- The amount of insulin controls the blood glucose levels.
- Type 1 diabetes results from a failure of the pancreas to produce insulin.
	- If they have too much glucose in their blood they experience hyperglycaemia
	- If they have too little glucose in their blood they experience hypoglycaemia.
