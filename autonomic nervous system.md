## Notes: 
- The autonomic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that controls smooth muscles and glands.
- The autonomic nervous system is a network of nerves that carries messages between CNS and the heart, lungs and other internal organs and glands.
- The ANS regulates, or controls, the functioning of internal organs automatically and unconsciously.
- Thus, the ANS is a system that functions independently of the CNS in maintaining the body's internal states and processes.
- There are two divisions of the autonomic nervous system:
	- The [[sympathetic nervous system]]
	- The [[parasympathetic nervous system]]
- The ANS is not completely self-regulating. It is linked to the brain's cerebral cortex where decision making and other more sophisticated information processing occurs, so we can voluntarily control a few autonomic responses at certain times.
