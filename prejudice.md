### Notes: 
Prejudice means "pre-judgement"
- Prejudice can be positive or negative
- There are four characteristics of prejudice:
	1. They tend to believe that they are superior to the minority group to whom the prejudice is directed at.
	2. The majority group tend to believe the minority group is different from them and that they 'do not belong'.
	3. The majority group tend to believe that they are more powerful and important than the minority group.
	4. A majority group that displays prejudiced attitudes is insecure, fearing the minority group may become more powerful and important than themselves.
- Modern prejudice is a form of prejudice which tends to be subtle, hidden and expressed in ways more likely to be accepted within the majority group.
- Old-fashioned prejudice is a form of prejudice in which members of the majority group openly reject minority group members and their views towards the minority group are obvious and recognisable to others. 
- Implicit prejudice is prejudice that is unconsciously held so the individual is unaware of it.
- Explicit prejudice is prejudice that is consciously held and deliberately thought about.
- [[Intergroup]] contact helps reduce prejudice.
