# Enzymes:

The small intestine produces 3 enzymes to complete digestion:
- Amylase breaks down starch into glucose.
- Protease breaks proteins down into amino acids.
- Lipase breaks fats down into fatty acids and glycerol

## General:
Q: Why are enzymes needed for digestion?
A: They increase the rate at which food molecules are broken down into their simplest form.
