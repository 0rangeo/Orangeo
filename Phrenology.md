## Notes:
- Phrenology is the study of the relationship between the skull's surface features and a person's personality and faculties.
- Towards the end of the eighteenth century, German physician Franz Gall proposed that different parts of the brain had different functions.
- This concept is now known as [[localisation of brain function]]
- Phrenology was also used as a means of making personality and behavioural assessments. 
	- To do this, people used a method called cranioscopy in which a device was placed around the skull to measure its bumps and depressions. The measurements were then analysed and linked to a phrenological map to determine the person's likely personality and behavioural characteristics.
