### Notes:
- An attitude is an [[evaluation]] a person makes about an object, person, group, event or issue.
- Attitudes are modeled by a [[tri-component]] model: 
- [[Affective component]] - How we feel about the attitude object.
- [[Behavioural component]] - How we act towards the attitude object.
- [[Cognitive component]] - What we know or think we know about the attitude object.
 
 Sometimes our [[Behavioural component|behaviour]] is [[consistency|consistent]] and other times it is [[inconsistency|inconsistent]] with our [[attitudes|attitude]].
 
 There are four factors that influence attitudes: 
 - [[Classical conditioning]]
 - [[Operant conditioning]]
 - [[Social learning]]
 - [[Repeated exposure]]
