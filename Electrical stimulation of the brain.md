## Notes:
-  Weak electrical signals are generated continuously by neurons throughout the brain. 
-  Electrical activity in the brain can either be stimulated or detected using an electrode. 
-  ESB is a form of electrotherapy achieved by stimulating a neuron or neural network in the brain by using an electric current.
-  ESB may not only initiate a response, it may also interfere with the functioning of a specific brain area.
-  The inhibitory effect of ESB is only apparent when a person is actively engaged in the behaviour that it blocks, and is most evident in complex functions such as language and memory.
-  The first reported use of ESB dates back to the 1870's when Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig
