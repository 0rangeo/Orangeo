Sulfuric acid removes water in esterification reactions

Why diamond sublimates

Why can graphite conduct electricity but diamond can't

Complete pathways for ester reactions

Uv light for what?
Uv light for substitution reactions, e.g alkane and a halogen

when do you need potassium dichromate?

more carbon chains means higher boiling point which means polar group is a smaler part and overall becomes more nonpolar and then lower solubility in water.

Alkane to alkyl halides alkanol to alkanoic acid to ester

In graphite each carbon atom is bonded to how many other carbon atoms?::3 other carbon atoms
<!--ID: 1623472823984-->

In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to how many other carbon atoms?::4 carbon atoms
<!--ID: 1623472824150-->


Q: Why is graphite conductive?
A: Graphite consists of carbon atoms covalently bonded to 3 other carbon atoms. As carbon has 4 valence electrons, there is one delocalised electron that is left over and this free moving electron allows graphite to conduct electricity.

Q: What is the relationship between the boiling point of organic substances and their solubility in water?
A: As the boiling point of organic substances in the same homologous series increases, their solubility in water decreases. The boiling point increases due to longer carbon and hydrogen chains forming more dispersion forces between each other. Longer carbon and hydrogen chains means that overall the molecule is more non-polar and if there's a polar group it becomes an ever smaller part of the molecule. Therefore as water molecules are polar, they are more likely to be attracted to each other than the organic substances. Thus, as the boiling point of organic substances in the same homologous series increases, their solubility in water decreases.

Questions for organic pathways

1) Is it ok to write liquid as the state of ethane? Would aqueous be more appropriate? If i wrote aqueous for ethane would hydrogen bromide and bromoethane also be aqueous?
2) Is potassium hydroxide aqueous? If potassium hydroxide is aqueous does that make ethanol and potassium bromide also aqueous?
3) On the prac solutions it says dilute sulfuric acid. Do i need to write dilute sulfuric acid and does the state change depending on if it's concentrated or dilute sulfuric acid? Would i need to write the state of potassium hydroxide as well and if so what would it be? (I would guess aqueous).
4) Do i need to write concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst for this reaction? How does the acid help with this reaction? Is heat also required for this reaction?
